# The Terrifically Tasteful TaxAPI
A simple tax API that does Australian tax calculations given a Gross pay packet

I have built this to play around with APIs and as general OOP practice.

Further to that a coding challenge for folks working with my current employer is to write up a simple tax calculator, factoring in the following:

Gross package (annual) 
Superannuation contribution (annual) 
Taxable income (annual) 
List of deductions and their annual amount, deductions included: 
Medicare Levy Budget Repair Levy Income tax 

Net income (annual) 
Pay packet amount

My first though was: "Ah! I will simply connect my console app to an existing Australian API that gives tax information! Easy!"... however no such public API exists in Australia! Not to be deterred (and if you see my sudoku calculator you will know) I decided to hit this one with a little more effort than usual.

It was a good experience to build this up and I know it is not perfect and it could use some work, and as someone who is always open to critique and learning something new: Please let me know if you spot anything I should change.

This Tax API is correct as of 2020s tax year and I have compared the answers it gives to paycalculator.com.au as a comparison to ensure proper answers.

NOTE: It goes without saying, but just in case: Do not use this app as tax/financial advice.
