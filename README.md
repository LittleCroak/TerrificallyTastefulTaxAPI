# TerrificallyTastefulTaxAPI
A simple tax API that does Australian tax calculations given a Gross pay packet

I have built this to play around with APIs and as general OOP practice. 

This Tax API is correct as of 2020s tax year and I have compared the answers it gives to paycalculator.com.au as a comparison to ensure proper answers.

NOTE: Do not use this app as tax/financial advice.
